# See https://zmk.dev/docs/development/hardware-integration/new-shield for more
# instructions.

# This file will be copied into the user's config directory when they add this
# keyboard. Define any Kconfig options users may frequently want to set here,
# but leave them commented out, for example:

# Uncomment to enable the encoder
# CONFIG_EC11_TRIGGER_GLOBAL_THREAD=y

# Uncomment to enable the display
# CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY=y

# Make sure USB support is enabled
CONFIG_ZMK_USB=y

# --- Core Bluetooth Enablement ---
CONFIG_ZMK_BLE=y               # Enables ZMK Bluetooth functionality

# --- Split Keyboard Specific Bluetooth ---
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT=y             # Enables general split keyboard support (you likely have this already)
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE=y         # Specifies that the split halves communicate via Bluetooth LE

# --- Optional but Recommended Settings ---

# Enable Bluetooth Security (Strongly Recommended)
CONFIG_BT_SMP=y                # Enables the Security Manager Protocol (pairing, bonding)
# CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_PASSKEY_ENTRY=y # If you want to require passkey confirmation on pairing (more secure)

# Central/Peripheral Role (Usually defaults correctly)
# By default, the left side is central, right is peripheral.
# Only change this if you specifically want the right side to be central.
# CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_ON_LEFT=y # (This is the default, usually not needed)

# Multiple Bluetooth Profiles (Connect to multiple devices)
# Set how many devices you want to be able to pair with (Default is often 5)
# CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_PROFILE_COUNT=5

# Enable Battery Reporting over BLE (If your hardware supports it)
# CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_REPORTING=y

# Fix for ghost keypresses without switches installed
